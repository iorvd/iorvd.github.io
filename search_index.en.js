And our team wasn't an exception!\nA couple of months ago we started the migration from GCP to AWS. The process took\nus more than a couple of hours, and after solving several minor breaks, we were\ndoing the post-migration checks. The average load was fastly approaching normal\nwhen we discovered that our services leak memory.\n\nSaw-like spikes of mem.usage, very sharp, don't cut yourself!\nThis wasn't something urgent, as all our services were functioning normally (except\nthat they had to restart every N minutes, and the less memory we had dedicated to\na service, the more often they were restarting). But it was unexpected, and unpleasant,\nless to say.\nThe first thought was Uhhh, excuse us, AWS, are you trying to trick us with... whatever stuff you have there at your disposal?. That was a sweet thought as it'd\nmean delegating the problem and caring much less about it. But before\nrushing to AWS support we did a couple of checks if it can possibly\nbe that some of our internal changes caused this. Unfortunately,\nthat wasn't the case. We had all the latest versions built and deployed to our\nold production, then we did stop-the-world and after the database migration was done we\ndeployed absolutely the same versions of our services. So in regards to the architecture,\nversions and data, everything was (or should've been) the same.\n\nThe graph of GC duration jumped up like crazy\nThe obvious entrypoint to this issue, or the one that many people would probably start from,\nwas to profile the services and see who brought the disorder to our previously peaceful world.\nSo we started with profiling and... there was nothing. Well, not exactly nothing, but heap\nprofile showed that we had only a couple of megs data at most(!). For me it was a bolt of the\nblue, I definitely did not expect to see ~0 memory consumption. RSS of the process was reporting about\nGigabytes of used memory, and I was not ready to believe in that 8MiB nonsense. We started\ngenerating ideas what could possibly happen:\n\n\nWhat if it's not the Go's runtime which eats our precious resources?\nPossibly, but what can it be? Maybe cgo? We don't use it. How about our dependencies?\nWe checked and indeed we had 4 dependencies with cgo. However, 2\ndependencies out of 4 were from stdlib (unlikely they're guilty), the 3rd had a\ncgo indirect dependency but didn't use the entities with cgo from there. And the\nlast dependency had cgo enabled only for GOOS=\"darwin\".\nBut to make sure we're not missing anything we rebuilt the binary of one of\nthe services with CGO_ENABLED=0 and it didn't help. (Un)fortunately, it wasn't cgo.\n\n\nWhat if we do an U-shape turn of our thoughts and come from another side. What if go's\nprofiler says the truth?\nAfter some browsering we found one prominent issue, albeit old and resolved\none:\nA short recap of how RAM works from the OS's point of view. When a\nprocess requests some bytes, OS instead of giving the exact amount of memory gives\na page of a fixed size (the exact number depends on the OS and the hardware\nsetup, and usually ranges between 4-16KiB) and assigns it to the process. This\noptimises memory access and speeds up allocations (you don't need to request memory\nfor every 4 bytes you need), but in the same time it's ineffective from the memory\nutilisation perspective (do NOT search for how much memory is wasted due to\nfragmentation. You're gonna be upset. I warned ya).\nNow, there are 2 kinds of memory metrics in profiler: allocs and heap. Heap is\na snapshot of the current memory usage and as we already know it's less than 10MiB.\nAllocs is essentially the same, but cumulative. Allocs grows quite fast, because\nruntime constantly allocates/frees memory in huge amounts (~3+GiB at the time\nwhen we hit our 2GiB pods limit) and it's a non-trivial task to tell whether the value\nis abnormal or not. So we thought, okay, GC frees memory, but what if the\npages for some reason are not claimed back by the OS.\nGo's GC uses a variation of mark&amp;sweep\ncollector, which does Stop The World™, marks unreachable variables as to-be-cleaned,\nand on the next phase marks freed pages as prepared, meaning they're available\nfor new allocations. As you can see there's no 'return to os, what is\nrightfully its' stage. What happens in reality is os checks if there are\navailable for claiming back pages - prepared and if there are, then it collects\nthem, and now memory is truly freed. But if there's no memory pressure in OS, then\nsometimes it is reluctant\nto reclaim them. And what a surprise, on the node, on which our namespace was\nhosted, total RAM usage was less than 5%!\n\n\n\nBut how can we test the no-mem-pressure theory? Correct, spin up a service on a small\nnode and see what happens. Well, we did it and realised several things:\n\nOur testing and staging had much less resourses, but we could still reproduce\nthe leak on them even if we put them under requests pressure.\nTo reproduce the leak we had to put a decent amount of load on the service.\nOtherwise, no load - no leakage. (That's why we discovered it only when migrated\nto production).\n\nWe deployed an arbitrary service on our old GCP cluster to double-check and it was\nworking just fine, no memory leaks. So:\n\nour services indeed consumed a couple of megs at any point of time, but the process\nover several gigs.\na process consumed all the available memory eventually.\nputting a node under pressure had not effect\nit's not cgo, but we didn't rule out it completely as the go's profiler showed low\nmemory consumption.\n\nNevertheless, it was the dead end, and we had to start from the beginning.\nWe kept looking for clues, messing with services and infra and found out something\ninteresting. The old image version (~10 versions ago) of one service had no leak.\nWe quickly unsheathed our git bisects and started narrowing it down. But what we\nnarrowed it down to is that the only version leaking memory was the latest one.\nWhat? No sense at all. Totally.\nAnd that my dear friends was the moment when the God decided that enough of this\nspectacular performance, he came down from heaven to one SRE guy and gave him the\nbrightest thought.\nMigrating to AWS we also rounded some corners and decided that why we need to build both\ntesting and production images when we can have only one? Less hustle - more free space.\nNow, every time we triggered a deploy to testing, an image was built and uploaded to\nthe hub. After we tested the feat and decided that it's time to deploy it to prod, we\ndon't build an image anew, and use the testing one. Our images for testing and prod\nshould absolutely identical, but one tiny line made them differ:\n\nOMG!! And now the Universe converged, no wonder we were allocating that much recources,\nthe race detector is a well-known memory abuser! We checked for issues and here we\ngo:\nTheir Majesty The Culprit: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37233..\n\nA bug review: 2/10 🥰\nWe could totally feel this guy. Turns the race detector is not just a memory abuser, it's\na bottomless pit, a black hole absorbing\neverything around it.\n\nSmall comment at the bottom of the race detector guide. It was added there after the bug was discovered.\nThe motivation of having race detector enabled for testing env is dubious, but it\nwas in the Dockerfile long before any of us was in the company and we had\nno strong objections why it shouldn't be enabled before. We removed the -race\nflag from the build and lived happily ever after till new offers and layoffs did us part.\nConclusions:\n\nKnow your tools.\nKnow the tools for monitoring your tools.\nSee 1.\n\n","id":"https://ogesandr.com/posts/go-memory-leak/","title":"How we were debugging a memory leak in Go compiler"},"https://ogesandr.com/posts/how-we-updated-300-million-of-rows-in-postgres/":{"body":"[Originally posted at DOU.ua]\nThis article was written as a retrospective of our experience migrating large amounts of data in PostgreSQL.\nData migration is a fairly non-trivial task, and as our team discovered, in a resource-limited\nenvironment UPDATE of data is significantly more complex than INSERT or DELETE. We will\nreview the preconditions and kind of data we migrated, the requirements set for the migration,\nexplore the approaches we chose, and draw conclusions. This article will primarily\nbe useful to those planning to perform large data migrations and those who want to deepen\ntheir knowledge of PostgreSQL.\nPreconditions\nDuring a major refactoring of one of our services, we noticed some suboptimal data access patterns in\nin our database and decided to optimise them. Worth noting that this was not the only reason why we decided to perform the migration,\nbut since this is all that can be revealed publicly, let's assume that all the reasons added up in\na reasonable decision to migrate the data.\nLet's look at the example that mimics the behavior we had. There are\nthree entities — user, transaction, and transaction_details. The transaction details entity is\nlinked to the transaction, and the transaction is linked to the user. So in order to get user data by\ntransaction_details.id you first need to get the transaction detais, then get transaction,\nand only then get the data from the user. Our migration updated many fields, but for simplicity, we will consider in the query examples only updating the user_id field in the transaction_details table by transferring its value from the transactions table.\n\nA brief description of what we had and what our migration requirements were:\n\nThe base in which migration was carried out was under constant load and served live traffic ~20rps with ocasional spikes up to 150rps.\n\n\nhttp traffic database served\n\nWe needed to reduce the load on the database as much as possible to avoid downtime of critical components of the app.\nAt the same time we did not have strict restrictions on the migration execution time (provided that this\ndid not require the use of engineers' working time). A faster solution was better for us than an ideal\nsolution which would involve more human resources.\nWe did not have the opportunity to upgrade and then downgrade the database, but we added the maximum number of provisioned IOPS for our disk.\nThe fields that we planned to update (user_id) were immutable in the target-table (transaction_details). And once the row was created, they remained unchanged, so we did not need to worry about data races.\nZero data loss - we could not, for example, stop the database,\nmigrate the data, and then start database again.\n\nPreparation\nFirst, we started filling the newly created fields with data. This pinned the total number of rows\nacross all the tables we needed to update to around 320 million, with the largest table containing\n140 million records. Some of the configurational data we needed was in another database, but since\nthe data we needed was immutable, and we were not interested in new records (because they were\nalready automatically saturated with the data), in order to speed up the migration we completely\ncopied the required table from one database to another.\nResearch on approaches to migration\nAWS DMS\nWe use AWS as a cloud provider for our services. One of AWS services is a service for data migration\nbetween databases — DMS (Data Migration Service). AWS DMS allows you to migrate data between\nhomogeneous databases — Full Load and CDC, which consists of copying the main chunk of data in the\ndatabase and then applying all changes that have occurred in the old database via CDC. During this\nmigration, you can configure triggers that will modify the data — and as a result, you will get a ready\ncopy of the original database, but with all the necessary changes.\nAdvantages:\n\nmigration script execution speed.\nif you plan to upgrade your database, you can perform both the upgrade and migration at the same time, saving time.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nall components must be thoroughly tested, as there is a high probability of data loss at any\nmigration stage or, conversely, the presence of data after migration that should have been\ndeleted in the original table.\nif we want to update the tables in several iterations, then each DMS migration will involve\na significant amount of infrastructure team engineering resources, which were limited in our situation.\npreparing to migrate all the tables at once is more difficult, since in the event of an error during\nthe migration, it will have to be started from the beginning.\n\nOwn wheen-reinvented DMS\nIf the approach of migrating the main chunk and adding data via CDC works, but there is no need to\nupgrade the database, then why use DMS if you can perform the same operations on the existing database?\nLet's consider an example of what such a migration could look like:\n\nAdvantages:\n\nspeed of migration script execution.\neasier to replicate the migration environment, and as a result, easier to test individual components than in DMS\nless involvement of infrastructure engineers\nno problems with individual table migration.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nat the same time, there are significantly more components to test than in DMS.\nAlso, the logic of the migration itself is more complex, and accordingly, there\nis more room for a mistake.\n\nBatch updates\nThe idea behind updating data in batches is that it allows for a quick migration\ngiven the availability of database resources and a well-optimized query. In particular,\nthis method is the easiest in terms of mental overhead for engineers, as it is intuitive\nin understanding. And therefore it helps to avoid mistakes.\nInitially, we tried a fairly trivial and straightforward approach — to aggregate all\nthe data in one sql transaction and immediately update the target table.\n\nThis worked very slowly, the speed was about 3k rows/min. Simple math suggests that at\nthis rate, migrating one table would take ~50 days (assuming we would turn\nthe migration off at night). The first problem with the query above is that we waste the\ntime JOINing the tables. To avoid this, we created an auxiliary table to which we added\npre-aggregated data:\n\nThe second problem we encountered was less obvious, but no less significant.\nThe thing is that the tx_details_user_id_null_idx index does not speed up,\nbut in fact slows down UPDATE, since when updating table rows, this index\nalso needs to be updated. Thus, the advantages of the fast table reads are\nshadowed by the slow index updates. Therefore, we dropped it. After that the data was updating\nat ~5k rows/min rate, but we still were not satisfied with the speed.\nWe tried a few more rather bold ideas: vacuuming dead tuples after each iteration (it had almost no effect),\nplaying with the postgres settings temp_buffers, work_mem, effective_cache_size (also minimal impact).\nIn the end, after several iterations of changes, we came to the final version, the speed of which\nsatisfied us ~30k rows/min. Let's take a look at how we did it.\nFirst, we created a table in which we aggregated all the data we need:\n\nWe found that an important aspect is sorting the index by updated_at. When updating data,\nour ideal scenario is to read all the data from the tables that will be updated\nin the same order in which they reside on disk. This allows us to reduce the read overhead on it.\nIn PostgreSQL, the UPDATE operation is INSERT+DELETE, so when updating a row, its new versions\ncan be written to a different memory region than the current one. As a result, the probability that\nrows with close updated_at values ​​are close to each other is higher than any two arbitrary\nrows sorted by UUID.\nIt is worth noting that this should be updated_at, not created_at. If the table fillfactor is\n100% (the default value), then data updates with a high probability will be put on another table page,\nand the adjacent data risks be put far from each other after creation. We also tried sorting by\nctid, but, strangely enough, it turned out to be much slower compared with updated_at.\nWhen data is updated, indexes that reference the old version of that data are also updated.\nTherefore, it is a good idea to drop as many indexes of the updated table as possible\nand recreate them after the migration. We have observed ~10%-30% improvement in the speed of UPDATE\noperations after removing several large unused indexes.\nFor example, the query execution speed on a database clone with and without any indexes:\n \n  \n    \n    With indexes\n    W/o indexes\n  \n  \n    Batch size 1000\n    36 000\n    111 000\n  \n\nTo reduce the overhead of updates, MVCC might use HOT (Heap-Only-Tuples) optimization,\nbut in order for it to happen the update must meet certain conditions:\n\nthe update does not modify columns used in table indexes.\nthere is enough space on the table page that contains the old version of the row to fit the new version.\n\nAnd the second bullet above is the responsibility of the fillfactor - so if update-heavy workload dominates for a table\nit is worth thinking about creating tables with a fillfactor &lt;70-90%. This will improve\nthe speed of data updates during any migration as well.\nAt the end, our migration looked like this:\n\nTesting\nThe query planner takes into account the state of the table and the database,\nso any query analysis should be performed on real data in the production database.\nSince there is always a risk of breaking something in production, we spinned up\na clone of our production database and performed all hypothesis testing on it.\nAdditionally, we tested the migration segments via functional tests to make sure\nthat they do exactly what we want them to do. Before executing the migration in production,\nwe ran it in our test environments and verified that the data was migrated correctly.\nMonitoring and performance tuning\nWhen writing and executing migration, it is important to remember about domain-specific data access patterns.\n\nAre traffic spikes typical for services that work with the database? If so, you should consider reducing the speed of data migration.\nAre there data synchronizations that create additional load on the database at night? Perhaps it is worth disabling migration at night.\nHow and when is data unloading for DWH or cache and can migration affect it? We had some CDC logic built on triggers - we had to disable it so as not to burden the services that use it (about 20 million rows were updated every day).\nHow long will it take to update one batch? Since thousands of values ​are being updated ​in the batch, each row will be locked with FOR UPDATE lock. Can this negatively affect other concurrent queries?\nAre there any entities that use the database/table, the downtime of which directly affects the company's revenue? For us, such entities were endpoints that are responsible for conducting payments. During migration, it is important to identify such sensitive places and monitor whether requests are not falling due to timeout.\nWho and how monitors the migration process and who sits near the kill switch script in case of an incident threat?\nAfter migration, a significant number of dead tuples will be created and it is a good practice to clean them up using VACUUM ANALYZE.\n\nConclusions\nOver time, you may need to re-saturate old data with new data or reshape the structure of tables, but as your database grows,\nthis task becomes increasingly non-trivial. Increased query latency, disk degradation,\ndata loss/data races — all of these problems appear to engineers in a new light\nwhen it comes to large amounts of data, and performing routine manipulations requires\nincreasingly creative approaches and more time for preparation.\nIt is important to conduct more thorough and meticulous research on how you plan\nto perform the migration — from what script you will run to what metrics you will be\nable to look at if services dependent on the database begin to degrade.\n","id":"https://ogesandr.com/posts/how-we-updated-300-million-of-rows-in-postgres/","title":"Updating 300 millions of rows in PostgreSQL"},"https://ogesandr.com/posts/of-expert-trust/":{"body":"When I was a child I was fond of reading criminal stories and detectives. My\nfather had an extensive library of e-books by Agatha Christie and I read all\nof them many times. It was a long time ago and many of the plotlines\nvanished from my memory, although there's one I remember very well and the one\nI keep returning to every once in while.\nIn 1925, Christie published a short novel in The Blue Book Magazine called\n\"The Missing Will\". It's indeed quite short and you can familarise yourself\nwith it here.\nThe story begins with a young lady asking Poirot to investigate the case.\nHer uncle dies, and since he was sceptical about the women education, he leaves\nthe last will saying that unless his niece proves 'her wits' his property and\nall the money will go to charity. The woman hires Poirot, who (of course)\nsolves the mystery, finding another 2nd will written in invisible ink. And at\nthe end Hastings and Poirot have an argument:\n\nAnd that thought resonates soo well in my mind. The right person might solve\nthe problem 50x time faster than you, sometimes all it takes is to ask for\nhelp. Being professional doesn't always mean 'being able to solve all the\nproblems', sometimes it's 'being able to solve the problems as fast as possible\nusing the available tools and people'.\nI remember Tony Fadell in 'Build' said that \"be CTO/Tech lead is not about being the\nbest engineer in the company/team\", which makes sense.
